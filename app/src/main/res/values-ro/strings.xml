    <string name="warnHerChoice">You pull your sword out of the sheath from your back with a swift move, aiming the tip to her chest. \n            \n \n\n            \" Stay were you are!\" you yell at her. Now she is close enough for you to see her better. She is tall, dressed with an old black dress. Her hair is as dark as the obsidian, and her eyes even darker.\n            \" I can smell your fear, reaper\", she said.\n            \n \n\n            \"I wonder what will you smell when your head will stay at your foots?\"\n            \n \n\n            \"You are so bold.\" A smirk spread across her face. She grabbed your sword from the cut, and in less than a second it shattered in one thousand pieces. \n            You\'re trying to cover your head with the hands, but not fast enough. A piece scraped your face, drawing a red line from the chin to your right ear.\n            Your sword is broken, but you still have two knives sheathed on the belt. Another option can be to cast a protective spell around you, which should reflect her spells.\n            \n \n \n            What do you do?</string>
